# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.  
It is part of the [GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow).

## Live Website

ðŸ‘‰ [https://johnufo.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/](https://johnufo.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/)

## How it works

- The repository contains a simple `index.html` file.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is configured to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
- The workflow only triggers when `index.html` is changed and pushed to the `main` branch.
- The site is automatically published to GitHub Pages.
